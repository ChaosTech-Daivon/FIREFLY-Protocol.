### What is FIREFLY?

**FIREFLY** is a proprietary chaos-based signal generation protocol designed to disrupt, confuse, and overpower autonomous drone swarms and RF-reliant systems in hostile environments.

Inspired by the nonlinear communication of fireflies in nature, this system generates unpredictable, pseudo-random chaos bursts across RF bands — creating a digital smokescreen in contested airspace.

### Tactical Capabilities

- **Frequency Hopping**: Ultra-fast band switching to avoid detection or jamming.
- **RF Entropy**: Generates high-variance output sequences to maximize swarm confusion.
- **Signal Cloaking**: Blends chaotic emissions with ambient EM noise.
- **Modular Emission**: Customizable for battlefield or covert deployments.

---

### Applications

- Drone countermeasures
- Battlefield signal dominance
- Autonomous system misdirection
- Tactical RF obfuscation
